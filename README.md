## Setup and Installation
Clone the repo from Github or download the files, and navigate to the application folder in your terminal. Execute the following commands to set up the database and backend:
```
$ cd donjons-and-dragons-api
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails s
```
This will set up the api for the backend of the application at http://localhost:3000

To begin play, navigate back to the frontenddirectory of the application in the terminal (or in your file explorer):
```
$ cd ../frontend
```
After navigating to the frontend directory, use your preferred browser to open frontend/index.html. The application was only tested on Google Chrome, so that would be the best browser to use.

On mac:
```
$ open index.html
```
--or--
```
$ open -a "Google Chrome" index.html 
```
On linux:
```
$ google-chrome index.html
```
With the page open in your browser, you will have to create an account by clicking on the "Sign Up" button on the upper right. This will allow you to save your progress in the game!

Then make a new character, and you're ready to start your adventure!
